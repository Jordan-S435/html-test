            <p>Anakin started his journey at around 8 when <em>Jedi Knights</em> brought him in for his high force potential. He grew the ranks over several years and eventually became a Jedi Knight and one of the greatest generals during the Clone Wars. His story after the Clone Wars takes a darker twist, but that's a different story.</p>
